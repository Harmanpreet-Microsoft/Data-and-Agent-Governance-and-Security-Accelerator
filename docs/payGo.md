Some policies mention pay-as-you-go (PAYG) because Microsoft offers this as an alternative billing model for certain services and features. Here’s why you see it referenced:

1. What Pay-As-You-Go Means

Instead of buying prepaid licenses or capacity upfront, PAYG lets organizations link an Azure subscription and pay based on actual usage (e.g., number of messages, storage consumed, or API calls).
Think of the Azure subscription as a credit card for cloud services—charges accrue monthly based on consumption. [Purview pa...guidelines | Word]


2. Why Policies Reference PAYG

Flexibility: Enables departments or projects to scale without committing to fixed license counts.
Cost Efficiency: Ideal for unpredictable workloads or pilots where usage varies.
Integration with Admin Centers:

Microsoft Admin Center (MAC) and Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC) allow admins to configure PAYG billing policies for services like Copilot Chat, SharePoint Agents, and Purview analytics.
These policies often require linking an Azure subscription, selecting a resource group, and defining billing scopes. [Agent Admi...e - Latest | PowerPoint]




3. Examples of PAYG in Microsoft Services

Purview DSPM: PAYG supports advanced analytics and scanning features for large data estates.
Copilot & SharePoint Agents: PAYG policies enable Copilot Studio bots in SharePoint when users lack M365 Copilot licenses.
Power Platform: PAYG applies to Power Apps per app, Dataverse capacity, and request meters—customers pay only when apps run or storage is consumed. [Power Plat...you-go FAQ | PDF], [07. Power...you-go FAQ | PDF]


4. Why It’s in Policy Language

Policies must clarify billing dependencies because enabling certain features (e.g., Copilot agents or Purview analytics) requires PAYG configuration.
It ensures admins understand that usage-based charges will apply if PAYG is turned on.
